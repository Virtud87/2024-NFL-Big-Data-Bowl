        "In the dynamic world of American football, where every play counts and player performance is meticulously analyzed, I introduce the novel metric, the Tackle Impact Rating (TIR), as a crucial tool for helping assess defensive players' effectiveness. The TIR metric provides a comprehensive insight into a defender's ability to make impactful tackles on the field. It goes beyond merely quantifying the number of tackles executed by a player, delving into the quality and influence of those tackles within the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, the Tackle Impact Rating (TIR) serves as a sophisticated measure that evaluates the significance and effectiveness of a defensive player's tackles during gameplay. While traditional statistics may capture the volume of tackles made by a player, TIR strives to encapsulate the qualitative aspects, shedding light on the impact each tackle contributes to the team's defensive strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIR is not a singular, straightforward statistic but rather a composite metric derived from various contributing factors. It considers multiple facets of a tackle, such as the tackled player's position on the field, the yardage gained or lost after the tackle, and whether the tackle led to a change in possession or even a safety or a touchdown. By combining these elements, TIR aims to assign a numerical value that represents the significance and effectiveness of each defensive player's tackles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The metric's methodology typically involves a combination of data points from engineered features extracted from game records, player tracking, and situational analysis. Advanced analytics play a pivotal role in processing vast amounts of intricate game data to derive meaningful insights into player performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the core objectives of TIR is to offer a more nuanced and holistic evaluation of defensive prowess beyond the traditional tackle count. For instance, a player making fewer tackles but consistently executing impactful tackles resulting in significant yardage loss or a turnover for the opposing team might receive a higher TIR than a player with a higher volume of tackles but less impact on the game's dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical application of the TIR metric extends beyond individual player assessments. Teams and coaching staff leverage this metric to make informed decisions, such as player selection, defensive strategy refinement, and performance optimization. After all, TIR for each defensive player can be combined to get an idea of how the defense as a whole is performing relative to tackling performance. Additionally, it aids in identifying key players who excel in making influential tackles and understanding their contributions to the team's overall defensive effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's essential to acknowledge that while TIR provides a comprehensive assessment of tackling effectiveness, it might not encapsulate every aspect of a defender's performance. Other defensive contributions, such as pass coverage, interceptions, or quarterback pressures, also significantly influence a player's overall defensive value."

Taking the average allows for standardizing the scores and comparing them between a defender's different games and between other defenders.\n",
